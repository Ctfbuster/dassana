# Updating Dassana

The Dassana team and community are hard at work publishing regular updates, including new actions and more workflows to help you stay on top of your alerts.

Updating Dassana to the latest and greatest version is dead simple.

1. In the AWS console, navigate to the CloudFormation service.
2. Click on the Dassana stack you deployed.
3. Click on the `Update` button on the top right.
4. Select `Replace current template`.
5. For the `Template source`, select `Amazon S3 URL` and enter the following `https://s3.amazonaws.com/dassana-prod-oss-public.dassana.io/latest/cft.yaml`.
6. Click next until the final page, select `I acknowledge` for all the checkboxes, and `Update stack`.

Easy peasy üçã squeezy.
