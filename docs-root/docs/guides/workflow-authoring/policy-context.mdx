# Policy Context

Security policies are written using `policy-context` workflows. A single Dassana policy can be mapped to multiple vendor policies.

## Example

Here is an example of an AWS security group policy for SSH from the internet.

```yaml title="content/workflows/csp/aws/service/ec2/resources/security-group/policy-context/ssh-from-internet.yaml"
schema: 1.0
type: policy-context
id: ssh-from-internet
name: Security group is allowing incoming SSH traffic from internet
labels:
    - contextualization

category: networking
subcategory: firewall

filters:
    - vendor: aws-config
      policies:
          - 'restricted-ssh'
      match-type: any
      rules:
          # here workflowId refers to the normalizer workflowId which normalized the alert
          - .workflowId == "aws-config" and (.vendorPolicy |contains ("restricted-ssh") )
    - vendor: prisma-cloud
      policies:
          - '617b9138-584b-4e8e-ad15-7fbabafbed1a'
      match-type: any
      rules:
          - .workflowId == "prisma-cloud" and .vendorPolicy == "617b9138-584b-4e8e-ad15-7fbabafbed1a"

steps:
    - id: list-of-attached-eni
      uses: WhatEnisAreAttachedToSg
      with:
          - name: groupId
            value: .resourceId
          - name: awsRegion
            value: .region

risk-config:
    default-risk: high
    rules:
        - name: are-enis-attached-to-sg
          #in the below condition, we are checking if the step with id "list-of-attached-eni" has a key with nameed 'result' and its value (array size) has length 0
          # i.e. we are checking if ENIs are attached to the security group or not
          condition: ."list-of-attached-eni".result| length == 0
          risk: low
```

### `schema`

<Schema />

### `type`

Always `policy-context` for this kind of workflow.

### `id`

<Id />

### `name`

<Name />

### `labels`

<Labels />

### `category` & `subcategory`

Used to organize security policies based on the use case. A list of all categories and their subcategories can be found [here](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/blob/main/content/workflows/policies/categories.yaml).

### `filters`

<Filters />

#### `vendor`

Security vendor name. A complete list of supported vendors can be found [here](https://github.com/dassana-io/dassana/tree/main/content/workflows/vendors).

:::note

Don't see your security vendor on the list? Learn how to go about adding a security vendor [here](../vendor-setup/adding-vendors).

:::

#### `policies`

List of vendor policy IDs from which map to a Dassana policy. AWS has a policy with the id `restricted-ssh`. In Dassana, the equivalent policy has the id `ssh-from-internet`. This field is used to map AWS Config's `restricted-ssh` policy to Dassana's `ssh-from-internet` policy.
