#### `default-risk`

Must be one of:

-   critical

-   medium
-   low

The empty string `''` denotes a null type when no risk wants to be added.

(Optional) The rules to run in order to detemine what risk to assign.

When writing rules, there are some best practices to keep in mind.

Let's say for example that we want to write a rule for security groups to ensure that they are not left open to the internet. Well one of the conditions we could write would be to check and see if there are any attached enis to the security group in question.

We could go about doing this one of two ways:

Approach 1: 👎

```yaml
name: are-enis-attached-to-sg
condition: ."list-of-attached-eni".result| length == 0
risk: low
```

Approach 2: 👍

```yaml
name: are-enis-attached-to-sg
condition: ."list-of-attached-eni".result| length > 0
risk: high
```

While both conditions are very similar there are some major gotchas with the first approach (making it a bad choice). What if our security group is attached to a lambda function?
When we do a point-in-time check for attached enis using our `list-of-attached-eni` action, there is a high probability that the lambda function could be shut down hence there being 0 attached enis. This would result in an alert which is low but should have actually been high if the security group is indeed open to the internet.

So whenever you are writing conditions, ensure that you are doing higher confidence checks.
