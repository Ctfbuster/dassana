# Low level Dirty Details

Let's talk about workflows and actions in detail. We will not talk about how to author them, but rather what do they do

## Workflows

As we know by now, these are YAML files which tells the engine how to process the alert.
As soon as an alert is received by Dassana, the very first workflow that gets run is of type `normalize`

import Normalization from '../getting-started/concepts/normalization.md'
import GeneralContext from '../getting-started/concepts/general-context.md'
import ResourceContext from '../getting-started/concepts/resource-context.md'
import PolicyContext from '../getting-started/concepts/policy-context.md'

### Normalize workflow

<Normalization />

Visit [content authoring](./guides/workflow-authoring/normalize.mdx) section to learn how to author your own normalizer or make edit to existing one.

## Context workflows

There are three types of context workflows and their job is add context to the alert and use the context to evaluate the risk as defined in their
respective `risk-config` field

### general-context

<GeneralContext />

### resource-context

<ResourceContext />

### policy-context

<PolicyContext />

## Actions

import Action from '../common-fields/actions/about.md'

<Action />
